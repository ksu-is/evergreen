# evergreen

The Evergreen project is based around a Discord Text-Based Horror Bot. Players will play as a Student (only in the prologue) and make story-altering decisions in an attempt to change the way the game plays out. Based on the decisions in the prologue, the other chapters will play out (where they switch to the Detective solving the mysteries)
